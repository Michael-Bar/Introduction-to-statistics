# Introduction to statistics

This is my short introduction to statistics. I designed and built this course for [One Acre Fund](https://oneacrefund.org/) to quickly train their data analysts and data scientists in basic statistical concepts that are vital to trial design and analysis. Due to the atypical background of One Acre Fund analysts, this course is designed to be as math-lite as possible. The aim of this course is therefore to build a kind of statistical *intuition* and statistical critical thinking. 

At the end of this course, the reader should be able to oversee, design, and analyse a variety of trials important in impact-evaluation and product innovation. 

## [Lesson 1 - Distributions, power and sample size](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP-1-distributions.html#)

**Highlights:**
* Interpreting and plotting distributions 
* Null hypothesis testing, p-values and significance
* Non-parametric hypothesis testing
* Power and sample size calculations
* Monte-Carlo methods for non-parametric power calculations


## [Lesson 2 - intra-cluster correlation and effective trial design](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP-2-RCT-principles.html)

**Highlights:**
* Formulating effective hypotheses
* Randomization
* Intra-cluster correlation and sample size
* P-value thresholds (aka alpha levels)
* Using minimum detectable effects in sample size calculations

## [Lesson 3 - Linear regression and mixed effect models](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP-3-regressions_NHT.html)

**Highlights:**
* Analysing cluster randomized trials 
    + Summarizing clusters
    + Cluster-robust methods with mixed-effect models
* Diagnosing and interpreting regression methods

## [Lesson 4 - Logistic regression](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP4_RCT_analysis_p2.html)

**Highlights:**
* Analysing binary outcome variables
    + Fixed effect models
    + Mixed effect logistic modelling

## [Lesson 5 - Advanced statistical concepts](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP5-summary.html)

**Highlights:**
* Introducing the multiple comparison problem (and corrections)
* Introducing positive predictive value and other advanced thoughts on power
* Refreshing some useful R functions
